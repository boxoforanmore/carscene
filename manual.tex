{\bf How to Make a New Texture}
\medskip

Use browser to download a JPEG file into the folder {\tt Pictures}, say
named {\tt dog.jpg}.
\medskip

Enter the command:
\smallskip
\quad {\tt j Convert dog}
\smallskip
to convert {\tt dog.jpg} to raw format, named just {\tt dog}.
\medskip

To use a sub-rectangle of the image, enter the command:
\smallskip
\quad {\tt j Clipper dog}
\smallskip

Move and resize the clipping rectangle by pressing keys
{\tt l}, {\tt r}, {\tt u}, {\tt d},
{\tt w}, {\tt n}, {\tt t}, {\tt s}
as desired (press keys {\tt 1}, {\tt 2}, {\tt 3}, {\tt 4} to
change the number of pixels used for each of these commands).
\medskip

When you have the sub-rectangle you want, press {\tt esc} to
save it as a new raw format file named {\tt dog-1}.
